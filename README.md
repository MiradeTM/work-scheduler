# work-scheduler
This application can be used to keep your day and your plans organized by hour.
If a time block appears green it is still a future event, if a time block appears red, it is the current hour, and if a time block appears gray, then that time block has already passed.
You may schedule an event by simply clicking inside the empty time block and typing in your event. You can then click the set button in the same row as the block you just edited and it will set that event to your schedule. To edit your schedule simply click in the desired time block, change the text, and hit set again.
Events are stored in local storage so if you restart the page or close it and come back, your events will still be there.
